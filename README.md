# ab-chess *[Under development]*

An object oriented chess program written in Javascript. 

This project is based on my previous work available on http://net-echecs.olympe.in/ .

My main goal at this moment is to "translate" my code from french to english and of course to improve it too.
Then I would like to make a new website to introduce the all project.

## What can AbChess do ?

AbChess is an API to manage chess software. It can (it will able to) :

* draw chess boards.
* check moves legality.
* import / export PGN files.
* import / export FEN strings.
* 

Features list to follow... See the provisional [AbChess API documentation](https://github.com/Nimzozo/ab-chess/blob/master/js/abChess-0.1/readme.md) for more informations)
