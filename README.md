# ab-chess

An object-oriented chess script mainly written in Javascript.

This project is based on my previous work available on http://net-echecs.olympe.in/ .

My main goal at this moment is to "translate" my code from french to english and of course to improve it too.
Then I would like my make a new website to introduce the all project.
