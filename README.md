# ab-chess *[Under development]*

An object oriented chess program written in Javascript. 

This project is based on my previous work available on http://net-echecs.olympe.in/ .
My main goal at this moment is to "translate" my code from french to english and of course to improve it too.
Then I would like to make a new website to introduce the all project.

## Features

AbChess is an API to manage chess software. It will provide functions to access awesome features :

* draw chess boards
* customizable board with CSS

* highlight king in check
* detect checkmate / stalemate
* detect other results (draw by agreement, threefold repetition, 50 moves rule, resignation)
